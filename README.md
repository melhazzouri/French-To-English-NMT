# French To English Translation

Bonjour! Hi!

Within the European Union, French holds the distinction of being the fourth most widely spoken mother tongue, and depending on who you ask, it may even be the second most prevalent.A staggering 80 million individuals worldwide claim French as their first language, with 61 million of them residing in France. French-speaking communities can be found dispersed throughout various regions of the world.

Despite the language's global popularity as the "language of love," it remains challenging for many individuals to acquire French fluency. This is a hurdle that I, too, have encountered, having recently relocated to Montreal, Quebec.  I am using this project to build a Neural Machine Translation model to translate from French to English.
